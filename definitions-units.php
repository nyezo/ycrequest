		<p>Alkalinity - Constituents of a solution or water body, which are chemical bases that can neutralize acids. Alkaline rocks produce alkalinity when they dissolve.</p>
		<p>BECCS – energy production via combustion of plant biomass with the capture and storage of the resulting carbon dioxide; a form of negative-emissions energy production.</p>
		<p>Bicarbonate – a chemical compound composed of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, with the formula - HCO3. This is very a common dissolved, ionic constituent of the Earth’s hydrosphere/ocean and is the most abundant form of carbon on the Earth’s surface. Certain types of bicarbonate have important uses, e.g. sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, or baking soda.</p>
		<p>CCS – carbon capture and storage, typically referring to the removal of carbon dioxide from an industrial waste source and its storage in concentrated form underground</p>
		<p>CO2 - carbon dioxide; a colorless, odorless gas given off by the combustion of fossil fuels and other industrial processes, by the metabolism of biota and by volcanic and geothermal processes.</p>
		<p>DAC – the capture and concentration of atmospheric CO2 by engineered chemical and/or physical means whose end product is concentrated CO2 that can be stored or used.</p>
		<p>EJ - exajoule; 1 billion billion joules of energy, as used in international scientific literature. 1 joule = 1 watt second, thus 1 watt hour = 3,600 joules. See "kWh" and "TWh" below. </p>
		<p>Gt – 1 billion metric tons, or tonnes, e.g., 1 Gt CO2 is equivalent to about 70 days of US CO2 emissions. 1 Gt CO2 would fill about 180,000 Goodyear blimps (which would not fly since CO2 is heavier than air).</p>
		<p>H2 – hydrogen gas; typically formed by the splitting of water or methane.</p>
		<p>IPCC – Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, under auspice of the United Nations</p>
		<p>kWh – 1,000 watt hours of energy.</p>
		<p>NE – negative CO2 emissions or carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, as caused by various natural and engineered processes.</p>
		<p>OTEC – Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; a method of converting the vertical thermal energy potential in the ocean to electrical energy.</p>
		<p>Tonne – 1 metric ton = 1.1 US tons = 2204.6 lbs.</p>
		<p>TWh – 1 trillion watt hours of energy; 1 Wh is the energy required to light a 60 watt bulb for 1 minute. 1 TWh = about 2 hours of energy consumption by the US. World energy consumption = 160,000 TWh per year.</p>
