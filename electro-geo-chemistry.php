						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>Nature already removes about half of our annual CO2 emission through biotic and abiotic means. </p>
						<p>Rock and mineral weathering is an abiotic process that already removes XXXX tons of CO2. As rocks and minerals decay, elevated CO2 reacts with the surface water to create carbonic acid. Through a series of naturally occurring chemical reactions, CO2 reacts with rocks to create a material called bicarbonate. Bicarbonates are the largest carbon reservoir on Earth's surface, holding the equivalent of 139,000 gigatons of CO2. Rock and mineral weathering is a significant but slow example of nature's CO2 removal process. As rocks and mineral decay, elevated CO2 acidifies surface water making carbonic acid. This carbonic acid reacts on contact with the very large alkaline mineral reservoir of sand on the Earth’s crust consuming the acidity, removing CO2 and forming dissolved mineral bicarbonates. These bicarbonates then enter the ocean. Ocean bicarbonate is the largest carbon reservoir on the Earth’s surface (38,000 gigatonnes carbon primarily as dissolved bicarbonate or the equivalent of 139,000 Gt CO2).</p>
						<p>Electrogeochemistry refers to the electrochemical acceleration of this geochemistry. Electrogeochemistry builds off rocks and minerals' natural weathering by strategically placing common alkaline rocks and minerals within a saline water electrolysis cell. When powered by renewable energy, electrogeochemistry produces a solution that spontaneously converts to dissolved mineral bicarbonate and creates hydrogen gas (H2). When added to the ocean, these mineral bicarbonates would further increase alkalinity in seawater and help counter ocean acidification. Variations on this technology could also have the additional environmental benefits of cleaning wastewater, cooling the surface ocean and/or providing carbon and nutrients for marine aquaculture. The H2 produced can be substituted for fossil transportation fuel or it can be converted back to electricity using a fuel cell.  </p>
						<p>Electrogeochemistry technology has the ability to not only remove CO2 from the environment but also reduce CO2 emissions by generating hydrogen fuel that can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels.</p>

					<h2>In-depth description & science</h2>
					<p>The primary way that Nature consumes excess CO2 over geologic time scales is via rock/mineral weathering (Archer et al. 2009). Here, elevated CO2 acidifies the hydrosphere making carbonic acid that in turn reacts with the very large alkaline mineral reservoir on the Earth’s crust to consume the acidity and CO2, forming dissolved mineral bicarbonates. These bicarbonates then enter the ocean, explaining why, after a few billions years of mineral weathering, ocean bicarbonate is the largest carbon reservoir on the Earth’s surface (38,000 Gt C primarily as dissolved bicarbonate or the equivalent of 139,000 Gt CO2). Given this very large global capacity to consume and store CO2, it is of interest to find ways of cost-effectively accelerating this process so that it is relevant on human/biologic rather than geologic time scales.</p>
					<p>Over the past 10 years various methods of electrochemically accelerating the preceding mineral weathering have been discovered (House et al. 2007, Rau 2008, Rau et al. 2013, Lu et al. 2015). All of these methods utilize the chemistry generated during water electrolysis to facilitate mineral decomposition and CO2 transformation to mineral bicarbonate, hence the term "electrogeochemistry". While this does require energy to effect air CO2 removal, maybe half of the energy used can be recovered from the H2 produced.</p>
					
					<?php include "definitions-units.php"; ?>

					<p>A recent analysis (Rau et al. 2018) shows that the global potential for negative-emissions hydrogen (NE H2) to consume CO2 ranges from about 90 to 900 Gt CO2 /yr, based on the minimum and mean ranges in global renewable energy production potentials. For reference, annual human-caused CO2 emissions total about 40 Gt CO2/yr. Furthermore, NE H2 could also generate about 80,000 to 800,000 TWh/yr of zero-emissions energy as H2. Current global energy use is about 160,000 TWh/yr meaning that NE H2 could in theory also satisfy global energy demand with zero emissions. The preceding capacities are significantly larger than the the current IPCC favorite, negative-emissions energy technology – Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Yet NE H2 importantly avoids much of the land, water and nutrient impacts that would result from the enhanced land plant production required by BECCS.</p>
					<p><strong>But wait, there’s more -</strong> Adding additional mineral bicarbonate to the ocean provides  stable C storage, and avoids the risk of having to transport and inject concentrated CO2 underground as required by CCS, BECCS and DAC. Also, amending seawater with additional mineral bicarbonate adds alkalinity, helping counter the effects of increasing CO2-derived ocean acidity and thus restoring ocean chemistry and biology (Marburini and Thake 1999, Albright et al. 2016), a process that naturally occurs via ambient global mineral weathering, though on time scales of 10’s of kyrs.</p>
					<p>One variant of the preceding technology is to couple the NE H2 process with energy generated from direct microbial electrolysis as powered the chemical energy contained in wastewater (Lu et al. 2015). This beneficially reduces waste organic matter in such effluent and converts the energy it contains to H2, while also removing the excess CO2 contained in the effluent and in air. The system is then net-positive in terms of energy generation and net negative with regard to CO2 emissions. In the process of feeding, housing and clothing 7.5 billion people on the planet, there is no shortage of wastewater with which to power such a negative-emissions energy system.</p>
					<p>A second NE H2 variant is powered by Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion. OTEC has been researched for the past 100 years and utilizes the very large vertical thermal gradient in the ocean to generate electricity (Rau & Baird 2018). One beneficial feature of OTEC is that it can be designed to cool the surface ocean. Since the surface ocean has received and stored more than 90% of the excess heat generated by human activity (IPCC 2013) and because this heat is impacting marine ecosystems, most notably the Great Barrier Reef (Hughes et al. 2018), OTEC offers a way to help remove that heat to the deep ocean and hence help restore surface water ecosystems and provide global cooling. Conventionally, OTEC pumps seawater from a depth of 1000m to condense a working gas that vaporizes at the temperature of surface seawater. Placing a turbine electricity generator in the gas stream between the vaporizer and the condenser produces electricity. Releasing the cooling water at or near the ocean surface then cools the ocean downstream of the system. It also releases at the surface nutrients contained in the deep water, which could beneficially stimulate marine photosynthesis (natural or in aquaculture settings), effecting additional CO2 removal. We have also shown that such artificial upwelling of deep water by OTEC can be avoided (and OTEC efficiency increased) by allowing the working fluid (rather than seawater) to vertically transfer heat to the deep ocean (Rau and Baird 2018).</p>

					<h2>What makes it a frontier technology?</h2>

						<div class="col">
							<h4>Challenges - what is the non-starter:</h4>
							<p>Significant investment in R&D is needed to better determine: A) optimum designs, energy sources, mineral sources, operating procedures and hence costs of this technology per tonne of H2 produced and CO2 consumed and stored, B) the environmental and social benefits and impacts of the technology. At large scales the integration/substitution of H2 into existing electricity and hydrocarbon fuel infrastructure would be required.</p>
							<h4>What infrastructure companies would be required for implementation</h4> 
							<p>Manufacturers and distributors, renewable energy generators, together with engineering, environmental, economic, social and political  consultants</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<h4>Energy requirements</h4>
							<p>It is estimated that 556 kWh of electricity is required by the NE H2 process to remove and store 1 t CO2. A 500 MW renewable energy power plant dedicated to NE H2 could therefore consume and store nearly 8 million tonnes of CO2 per day while generating a little more than 2 million kWh in the form of H2. </p>
							<p>
								556 kWh = 1 ton of CO2<br>
								556 terrawatt hours = 1 gigaton of CO2  times 55 gigatons of CO2 per year<br>
								30580 terrawatt hours = 55 gigatons of CO2 per year (then I think we would subtract the NE H2, right?)

								<h3>Energy Required</h3>
								<p>It is estimated that 556 kWh of electricity is required by the NE H2 process to remove and store 1 t CO2. A 500 MW renewable energy power plant dedicated to NE H2 could therefore consume and store nearly 8 million tonnes of CO2 per day while generating a little more than 2 million kWh in the form of H2. </p>
							</div>
							<hr class="small">
							<div class="offset-text right">
								<h3>Connection to Other Ideas</h3>
								<p>1) The technology could be powered by excess renewable energy to allow energy storage in the form of H2 that could then be converted back to electricity (via fuel cells) for use during periods of peak energy demand.  Such energy storage is critically important for those forms of renewable energy that are intermittent, e.g., wind, solar, tidal, etc. 2) Because gasoline refining uses large quantities of H2, use of NE H2 here could significantly reduce the net CO2 emissions footprint of conventional gasoline. 3) The process could be coupled to and powered by waste water treatment (Lu et al. 2015), which would improve such treatment while generating energy and consuming CO2. 4) If powered by OTEC, NE H2 would provide a negative-emissions method (H2) of transporting abundant offshore renewable energy onshore while also helping reduce surface ocean warming and ocean acidification (Rau & Baird, 2018).  The downstream solution released by NE H2 will be rich in dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients that could feed biological or chemical synthesis of valuable products. </p>
							</div>
							<hr class="small">
							<div class="offset-text left" id="business-models">
								<h3>Possible Business Models</h3>
								<p>Create a profitable business where the cost of conducting NE H2 is more than offset by the market value or $ credit of one or more of the following products/services: i) H2 as a negative-emissions fuel, energy storage medium or chemical feedstock, ii) CO2 removal and storage, iii) ocean antacid, iv) co-produced oxygen or chlorine gases, v) co-produced silica, vi) C- and nutrient-rich solutions for subsequent biological or chemical synthesis. Initial analysis suggest that these revenue streams can significantly offset the cost of production, thus making a energy source, H2, that has very low or negative net cost, potentially the lowest of any energy source.  </p>
							</div>
							<hr class="small">
							<div class="offset-text right" id="estimated-costs">
								<h3>Estimated Costs</h3>
								<p>The estimated cost of energy production by NE H2 systems ranges from $0.07 to $0.63/kWh H2 while the predicted cost of CO2 removal ranges from $3 to $161/t CO2, such variations being a direct function of the cost of input renewable electricity, $0.01 to $0.29/kWh (Rau et al. 2018) and the market value of the H2 produced. These CO2 removal costs are equivalent to or substantially lower than those estimated for DAC, CCS and BECCS.</p>
							</div>
							<hr class="small">
							<div class="offset-text center" id="risks">
								<h3>Risks</h3>
								<p>NE H2 has only been demonstrated at small scales although related, larger prototypes of electrochemical seawater C and H2 stripping have been tested. While conventional water electrolysis has an energy conversion efficiency of about 70%, it is not known if similar efficiencies can be attained by NE H2, given the additional complexity of adding minerals to the anolyte and removing the alkalinity generated.</p>
								<p>While seawater would be the perfect electrolyte from a cost and capacity standpoint, seawater electrolysis discharges chlorine gas, Cl2, rather than oxygen gas, O2, at the anode.</p>
								<p>Also unknown are the downstream marine environmental impacts of alkalinity addition, if any. The ocean receives about 1 Gt CO2 in the form of dissolved mineral bicarbonate from natural mineral weathering with no ill effects to the ocean being apparent. The few, small-scale experiments done to investigate the effects of artificially elevated alkalinity have shown positive responses to resident biota. However, further research is needed to confirm that such addition at large scales would be benign if not beneficial and restorative. Upstream environmental impacts would stem from the increased mineral extraction, processing and transport needed to conduct NE H2 at large scales. A better understand of environmental and monetary costs/benefits is required before this technology can be widely deployed.</p>
								<p>Assuming that seawater can be used as the water and electrolyte source and that the ocean will be the recipient of the bicarbonate produced, the NE H2 will be geographically limited to coastal, near-shore or open ocean settings (about 70% of the Earth's surface).</p>

					<h2>What is the 2040 vision for the idea?</h2>
					<p>NE H2 is proven to have high global energy production and CO2 removal capacities while also providing additional environmental benefits, all at a cost that is very competitive with if not lower than other approaches. An entirely new global energy economy based on H2 arises that can safely and economically harness the vast coastal and open ocean renewable energy, drastically reducing global fossil energy use and CO2 emissions, and the geopolitical and climate tensions thereof. The generation of this negative-emissions energy is accomplished without significantly impacting global food, fiber and fuel production as would BECCS at equivalent scales. The world is then freed to concentrate on the remaining global threats: hunger, disease, overpopulation, conflict reduction, etc.</p>
